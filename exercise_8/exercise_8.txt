Exercise 8 - Dice Project
You have been hired by devsInc to create a landing page for their
new project. They want to support people playing tabletop games
from home and require a Dice Generator.
Features:
The user should be able to use different dice, such as a D6 or a D10
(number of faces).
• Define on paper, all the user stories (functionalities) you will need
for this page.
• Make a simple storyboard of the user using the system.
• Create a git repository for the project
• Clone the project locally
• Work on the project creating 2 branches, one for the UI, and one
for rolling the dice, committing and merging when completed.
• Create the roll functionality by passing an argument, in order to
reutilise the same function multiple times
• Write unit tests for the roll dice functionality.
• When complete, push the content to your git repository.

User Stories: 

I am the user, when I visit the webpage I want to be welcomed to 
devsInc's page and be able to read a description on how to use the dice feature.

I want to be able to select which size dice I would like to roll.

I want to be able to see clearly what the result of the dice is. 

I want to be able to roll the dice again as many times as I require. 

I want to be able to switch between using the two different sized dice.
